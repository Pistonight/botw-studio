# Getting Started
To start using a module, you need to first create a configuration on the client.

Write click on any widget, and select "Split" or "Open", and select "New Data Session"

In the new data session opened, specify the args

```js
{
    Module: "Name"        // Name of the module. See the module you want to use to see what the name is
    Output: "Output Name" // The preferred output window name.
}

```
